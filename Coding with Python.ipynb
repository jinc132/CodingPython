    "This Jupyter Notebook is particularly interesting since it investigates the relations between per capita values for gun related homicides to GDP and total homicides. It utilizes data gathered from Wikipedia and analyzes data from a international perspective by putting the U.S. situation in context relative to other nations. \n",
    "\n",
    "I particularly found interesting that compared to Canada and the United Kingdom, the likelihood of being killed is signficantly high. Which in effect is pretty extreme. Furthermore, I found it interesting that although his data and analysis concludes that relationship between the gun data and total homicides was valid, the author's conclusion seems to refute it. In contrast to what the data explains, another data source (FBI data) supports an argument that the influence of guns to homcides is close to half of what was stated by the author's initial analysis."
